# YouTube-subscription-manager
Let a robot do the work for you. subscribe and unsubscribe to any Channel you want without doing the work
if YT updates their UI this program might not work until I update it
so far can't unsub yet but will be added soon.
when picking who you want to sub to you must enter into the code (will be fixed soon)

wil add more features like, unsub to all, allow more then 1 channel to be subed to at once (only run the program once and sub to x amount of channels)

might break something if you spell the Channel name wrong or if it does not exist :(
